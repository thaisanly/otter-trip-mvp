## Testing Approach

### UI Exploration Before Test Creation

**CRITICAL: Always explore the REAL RUNNING UI using Playwright MCP tools before generating tests. Never write tests blindly without understanding the actual application structure.**

**SellUp Frontend Apps Running Locally:**
- **Admin App**: http://localhost:5173 (running in tmux session: admin)
- **Dealer App**: http://localhost:5174 (running in tmux session: dealer)  
- **Marketplace App**: http://localhost:5175 (running in tmux session: marketplace)

1. **Initial UI Discovery Phase - REAL APPS**
   - Use Playwright MCP to navigate to the ACTUAL running applications
   - Explore Admin app at http://localhost:5173 using `browser_navigate`
   - Explore Dealer app at http://localhost:5174 using `browser_navigate`
   - Explore Marketplace app at http://localhost:5175 using `browser_navigate`
   - Take accessibility snapshots with `browser_snapshot` to understand real page structure
   - Identify all interactive elements, forms, and navigation paths in the live apps
   - Document the actual element references and selectors found in running applications
   - Map out the complete user flow before writing any test code

2. **Element Verification Process - LIVE TESTING**
   - Verify each element exists in the running apps before creating Page Objects
   - Test interactions manually using MCP tools on live applications first
   - Confirm element selectors are stable and unique in actual UI
   - Validate that workflows complete successfully in running apps
   - Document any dynamic content or async behaviors observed
   - Test across all three apps to understand shared components

3. **Test Generation After Live Exploration**
   - Only write tests after exploring the real running applications
   - Base Page Objects on actual discovered elements from live UI
   - Use real element references from snapshots of running apps
   - Ensure test steps match verified user flows in live applications
   - Include proper waits based on observed load times in actual apps

### Test Architecture & Organization

- **Page Object Model (POM) MANDATORY**: Always create reusable Page Objects for every page/component
- Page Objects for maximum code reuse across test suites
- Shared Page Objects in common test utilities directory
- Component-level Page Objects for reusable UI elements
- Reusable test fixtures and helpers
- Data-driven testing with parameterization
- Test data factories and builders
- Environment-specific configuration
- Parallel test execution strategy
- Test tagging and categorization
- Smoke, regression, and critical path suites
- Continuous integration pipeline integration
- Test reporting and metrics dashboard

### MCP Tool Usage Strategy

- `browser_navigate`: Initial page navigation and URL testing
- `browser_snapshot`: Element identification and page state analysis
- `browser_click`: Interactive element clicking and navigation
- `browser_type`: Form filling and text input validation
- `browser_wait_for`: Dynamic content and async operation handling
- `browser_evaluate`: Complex DOM queries and JavaScript validation
- `browser_take_screenshot`: Visual regression and error documentation
- `browser_network_requests`: API call validation and performance monitoring
- `browser_console_messages`: Error detection and debugging
- `browser_handle_dialog`: Alert, confirm, and prompt handling

### Test Implementation Patterns

**IMPORTANT: Always create Page Objects for maximum reusability. Never write test actions directly in test files - encapsulate them in Page Objects that can be reused across multiple test suites.**

#### Step-by-Step Test Development Process

1. **Explore First**: Use MCP tools to navigate and understand the UI
2. **Capture Structure**: Take snapshots to identify element references
3. **Verify Interactions**: Test each action manually before coding
4. **Create Page Objects**: Build reusable components based on discoveries
5. **Write Tests**: Implement test cases using verified Page Objects

```typescript
// STEP 1: Explore REAL RUNNING UI before writing any test code
async function exploreSellUpApps() {
  // Explore Admin App (running on http://localhost:5173)
  await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: 'http://localhost:5173' });
  const adminSnapshot = await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
  console.log('Admin app elements:', adminSnapshot);
  
  // Explore Dealer App (running on http://localhost:5174)
  await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: 'http://localhost:5174' });
  const dealerSnapshot = await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
  console.log('Dealer app elements:', dealerSnapshot);
  
  // Explore Marketplace App (running on http://localhost:5175)
  await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: 'http://localhost:5175' });
  const marketSnapshot = await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
  console.log('Marketplace app elements:', marketSnapshot);
  
  // Test interactions on LIVE applications
  await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: 'http://localhost:5175/login' });
  const loginSnapshot = await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
  
  // Verify elements exist in REAL UI before creating tests
  await mcp__playwright__browser_type({
    element: 'Email input field',
    ref: loginSnapshot.emailInput, // Use actual ref from live app
    text: 'test@example.com'
  });
  
  // Document findings from REAL applications
  return {
    adminElements: adminSnapshot,
    dealerElements: dealerSnapshot,
    marketplaceElements: marketSnapshot,
    sharedComponents: ['navigation', 'footer', 'forms'],
    workflows: ['login', 'registration', 'checkout']
  };
}

// STEP 2: Create Page Object based on REAL UI exploration
```

```typescript
// MANDATORY: Page Object Model for EVERY page
// Location: tests/page-objects/LoginPage.ts
class LoginPage {
  async navigate() {
    await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: 'https://app.com/login' });
  }

  async login(email: string, password: string) {
    const snapshot = await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
    await mcp__playwright__browser_type({
      element: 'Email input field',
      ref: snapshot.emailInput,
      text: email,
    });
    await mcp__playwright__browser_type({
      element: 'Password input field',
      ref: snapshot.passwordInput,
      text: password,
    });
    await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
      element: 'Login button',
      ref: snapshot.loginButton,
    });
  }

  async verifyLoginSuccess() {
    await mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for({ text: 'Dashboard' });
    const snapshot = await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
    return snapshot.content.includes('Welcome');
  }
}

// Reusable Component Page Object
// Location: tests/page-objects/components/NavigationMenu.ts
class NavigationMenu {
  async selectMenuItem(item: string) {
    const snapshot = await mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot();
    await mcp__playwright__browser_click({
      element: `Navigation menu item: ${item}`,
      ref: snapshot[`menuItem_${item}`],
    });
  }

  async isMenuItemActive(item: string): Promise<boolean> {
    const result = await mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate({
      function: `() => document.querySelector('[data-menu="${item}"]').classList.contains('active')`,
    });
    return result;
  }
}

// Test file using Page Objects for maximum reusability
// Location: tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts
import { LoginPage } from '../page-objects/LoginPage';
import { NavigationMenu } from '../page-objects/components/NavigationMenu';

describe('Authentication Tests', () => {
  const loginPage = new LoginPage();
  const navMenu = new NavigationMenu();

  test('User can login and navigate', async () => {
    await loginPage.navigate();
    await loginPage.login('user@example.com', 'password');
    await loginPage.verifyLoginSuccess();

    // Reuse navigation component across all tests
    await navMenu.selectMenuItem('Profile');
    await navMenu.isMenuItemActive('Profile');
  });
});
```

### Page Object Best Practices

- **Create Page Objects for EVERY page**: No exceptions - every page needs a Page Object
- **Component Page Objects**: Create reusable Page Objects for shared components (headers, footers, modals)
- **Inherit common functionality**: Use base Page Object classes for shared methods
- **Organize in dedicated directory**: Store all Page Objects in `tests/page-objects/`
- **Descriptive method names**: Use business-level language (e.g., `submitOrder()` not `clickButton()`)
- **Return useful values**: Page Object methods should return data for assertions
- **Handle waits internally**: Page Objects should handle all waiting logic
- **Parameterize actions**: Make Page Object methods flexible with parameters
- **Document complex selectors**: Add comments explaining complex element selection
- **Version control Page Objects**: Track changes carefully as UI evolves
